# Pipelining the CPU
# **The Waterfall Logic Diagram**
When one logic circuit is executing one instruction, the succeeding instruction is executed by the next logic circuit(of next stage) which is pipleined, from the outputs of the preceding logic circuit.
*The issue with this* in Pipeling the CPU, is we cannot accuratley obtain the branch target, thus possibilities of change in logic while proceeding into next stage. This is known as Hazard in Pipelining.
